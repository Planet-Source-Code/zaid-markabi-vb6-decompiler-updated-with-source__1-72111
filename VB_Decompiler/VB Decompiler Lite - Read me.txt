VB Decompiler Lite

VB Decompiler is decompiler for programs (EXE, DLL or OCX) written in Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0. As you know, 
programs in Visual Basic can be compiled into interpreted p-code or into native code. 
If a program was compiled into the native code, restoring full source code from machine instructions is not possible. 
anyway you can edit any text or image which contained in EXE file .
_____________________________________

Just select EXE file, then edit any text and pictures, then compile edited data to new EXE file .
